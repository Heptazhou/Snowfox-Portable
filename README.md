#	Snowfox Portable
This is the portable launcher that is bundled with Snowfox. It allows for changing paths (so you can put it on removable storage) and will clean up remnants on the system after closing the browser. The portable version and an installed instance of Snowfox can be run simultaneously.

##	Getting started
* Download and extract [`snowfox-v*.win64.7z`](https://github.com/0h7z/Snowfox/releases/latest). It already contains a compiled version of the project hosted here.
* If you need a portable [`snowfox.config.js`](https://librewolf.net/docs/settings/#where-do-i-find-my-librewolfoverridescfg), you can put it inside the profile folder `Profiles\Default`.
Snowfox Portable *will not* use `%USERPROFILE%\.snowfox\snowfox.config.js`.
